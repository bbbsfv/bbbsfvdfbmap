# BBBS FV Deals for Bigs Map

This project is comprised of an interactive map which centers around the Fraser Valley and businesses which support Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Fraser Valley through our Deals for Bigs program and can be accessed here:[a relative link](/Work/bbbs.html)
## Cartographic Considerations

### Colour Iconography

The map is designed within the Big Brothers Big Sisters national branding guidelines in mind. Since the main purpose of the map is to connect matches with activies to participate in, parks were one of the exclusive coloured polygons on the map. Parks also feature lables where possible, and their inlusion on the map promotes healthy lifestyles and backing. 

The focus of the map is sponsored locations. This has two purposes. Initally they are easy to find for matches. The geolocation feature builds on this, providing locations that are nearby and easily accessable. Secondarily, they act as marketing for businesses. We appreciate the support we get from businesses and hope to promote them as much as possible. Future possibilities include differing icon sizes or 'prefered locations' which contribute more towards fundraising goals. Additionally, an alternative map could be included for major donors which could be included on our website.

### Interactiviy

As mentioned earlier, a geolocation feature is included to assist with relating the user to what is nearby. Additionally, a popup was created which gives the deal location's phone number and the deal description, and the cursor changes upon hovering cliclable opbjects to assit with usability. Zoom is also included. At this time mobile is not entirely supported but this could change in future iterations.

## Files Included

This repository contains the physical HTML file of the map, a geoJSON file which can be edited easily on the geoJSON.io website, as well as font files which assit with branding
